### Hi, I'm Chris ðŸ‘‹
### I'm fervently ingesting all things HTML, CSS, JavaScript and all things Web Development and having a great time doing it! Forged from years of adventuring through the realms of programming, and focused during fully engrossed experience at Learning Fuze coding bootcamp, I relish the opportunity to contribute and collaborate in expressing our world in digital landscapes!

#### I'm currently exploring React Hooks, TypeScript, Kintone, and CMS's such as SquareSpace / Webflow / WordPress.
#### CSS only solutions and animations are also a fascination of mine and I love learning more about the easy to hate, but powerful reach of CSS.
