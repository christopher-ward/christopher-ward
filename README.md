### Hi, I'm Chris ðŸ‘‹
### I love building things with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and learning all the great tools that make these languages even more powerful and streamlined.
### My most recent stack has been PostgreSQL, Express, React, and Node.
#### I'm currently exploring React Hooks, TypeScript, Kintone, and CMS's such as SquareSpace / Webflow / WordPress.
#### CSS only solutions and animations are also a fascination of mine.
#### I love learning more about the easy to hate, but powerful reach of CSS.
